3. Fragile adds â‚¹150 flat
4. Client Discount (on base + surcharge):
   - Gold: 15%
   - Silver: 10%
   - Bronze: 5%
5. FinalCharge = base + surcharge - discount (rounded)

### âš™ Assumptions
- Weight and Distance are always positive.
- ClientCategory is one of: Gold, Silver, Bronze. Others get 0% discount.
